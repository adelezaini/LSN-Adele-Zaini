The present folder is organised very similarly to the Molecular Dynamic one:

- input.dat: contains all the parameters of the simulation, that can be changed manually without modifying each time the program and then create its executable. The parameters are:
	- orbital: 1s or 2p;
	- starting position (x0,y0,z0);
	- time step;
	- number of steps;
	- number of blocks;
	- transition probability: Uniform or Gaussian;

- Uniform/Gaussian folders: contain the respective results for the positions of the random walk and the mean radius evaluated with data blocking, for each 1s and 2p orbital. They contain also a folder named "Origin" with data used to choose an accurate starting point (as explained in the Jupyter Notebook).
