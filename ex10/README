The files are organised in the same way of the GA exercise, in each folder SA (=Simulated Annealing) and PT (Parallel Tempering), except for:

- the main.cpp and input.dat ares different,
- population.cpp has been removed
- PT/Circonference and PT/Square contain results of each node and the 'bestest' one.
